Hi! I'm Nikit. I graduated from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) where I studied [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.northwestern.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I'm an experienced Software Engineer with expertise in building recommendation engines, data pipelines, analytics platforms, and search systems. Currently, I provide consultancy services to small businesses in India, helping them leverage AI tools and frameworks. Previously, I was the founding Machine Learning Engineer at Plot, a creative operations platform. Before that, I contributed to the recommendation engine for Amazon Style and worked as a Software Engineer at AWS.

### Experience  

**Kia Labs**  
*2024 - Present*  
I’m currently providing AI consultancy services at Kia Labs, helping small businesses in India leverage AI tools and technology to automate processes, streamline operations, and reduce costs.

**Plot**  
*2023 - 2024*  
I joined Plot as a founding engineer to architect and build an AI-focused creative operations platform for marketing teams. As part of the founding team, I helped conduct user research, identify pain points and deliver on product requirements for the initial MVP as well as the overall product. I built several of Plot's AI features including Smart Search, AI Auto-Organize and AI Social Listening.

**Amazon Style**  
*2021 - 2023*  
I was an early member of the engineering team that launched Amazon Style, a physical store that reimagined the fashion shopping experience by using personalized recommendations. In 2022, we launched Amazon Style in California and Ohio. I collaborated with Applied Scientists and Product Managers to design, build and optimize ML algorithms to deliver personalized recommendations via the in-store Amazon tablets and the Amazon app. Some key projects include clothing size prediction system, ML model deployment pipeline, and ML data egress system.

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**  
*2019 - 2021*  
I was a member of the founding team that built Amazon Connect Customer Profiles from scratch, an AWS service that works with Amazon Connect to empower call center agents with a more unified view of a customer’s profile by automatically bringing together their information from third party data sources such as Salesforce, Zendesk, ServiceNow etc. As part of the launch, I built highly scalable and low latency micro-services to ingest high volumes of data from supported third party sources.

Amazon Connect Customer Profiles launched at re:Invent 2020, an annual AWS conference.

I was also part of the engineering team at Amazon Pinpoint, a marketing AWS service that allows users to engage with their customers across multiple messaging channels such as push notifications, in-app notifications, emails, text messages, voice messages, and messages over custom channels.  

I was a core contributor to the Pinpoint Analytics services that measured marketing KPIs on millions of customer events in near real-time. Predominantly used EMR, Spark and Kinesis Data Analytics to build highly scalable micro-services to handle the high volume of data and still provide customers with near real-time analytics.

### Research  

**Investigating Systematic Bias in Text Generation Models**  
*Supervised by [Doug Downey](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/)*  
I explored  systematic biases in text generation models when exposed to a balanced set of information by training language models on controversial debate topics with clear pro/against stances such as China’s one-child policy, violence in video games and religion versus atheism.
