Hi! I'm Nikit. I graduated from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) where I studied [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.northwestern.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/).
Iâ€™m currently working as an AI Engineer at Plot, a creative operations platform. Previously, I worked on the recommendation engine powering Amazon Style. Before Amazon Style, I was a Software Engineer at AWS.
